    "Corina Koolen and Andreas van Cranenburgh's \"These are not the Stereotypes You are Looking For: Bias and Fairness in Authorial Gender Attribution\" examines the issue of bias in authorial gender attribution. They argue that existing methods for determining authorial gender are often biased, and propose a new approach that takes into account both linguistic and social factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Authorial gender attribution is a complex task.\" Koolen and van Cranenburgh note that determining authorial gender is a complex task that is often fraught with bias. They argue that existing methods often rely on stereotypes and are not reliable indicators of actual gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Bias in authorial gender attribution can have serious consequences.\" The authors note that bias in authorial gender attribution can have serious consequences, particularly in the academic and publishing worlds. They argue that gender attribution can impact hiring, promotion, and publication decisions, and that it is important to address bias in order to ensure fairness and equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Linguistic features alone are not sufficient for determining authorial gender.\" Koolen and van Cranenburgh argue that linguistic features alone are not sufficient for determining authorial gender, as these features are often influenced by social factors such as age, education, and dialect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Social factors can also influence authorial gender attribution.\" The authors note that social factors such as authorial self-presentation, publication context, and audience expectations can also influence authorial gender attribution. They argue that it is important to take these factors into account in order to reduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Machine learning algorithms can perpetuate bias if not carefully designed.\" Koolen and van Cranenburgh note that machine learning algorithms can perpetuate bias if they are not carefully designed. They argue that it is important to evaluate algorithms for fairness and to identify and correct sources of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"A multi-factor approach is needed to address bias in authorial gender attribution.\" The authors propose a new approach to authorial gender attribution that takes into account both linguistic and social factors. They argue that this multi-factor approach is needed in order to reduce bias and increase fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Our approach focuses on the identification of unexpected linguistic features.\" Koolen and van Cranenburgh's approach focuses on identifying unexpected linguistic features that are not typically associated with either male or female authors. They argue that these unexpected features can provide a more accurate indicator of authorial gender than traditional linguistic markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Our approach is designed to reduce gender-based stereotypes.\" The authors note that their approach is designed to reduce gender-based stereotypes in authorial gender attribution. They argue that by focusing on unexpected linguistic features, their approach can provide a more nuanced and accurate picture of authorial gender that is not based on stereotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Fairness should be a guiding principle in the design of machine learning algorithms.\" Koolen and van Cranenburgh emphasize the importance of fairness in the design of machine learning algorithms. They argue that algorithms should be evaluated for fairness and that bias should be identified and corrected in order to ensure equitable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Reducing bias in authorial gender attribution is a step towards greater fairness and equity.\" The authors conclude by arguing that reducing bias in authorial gender attribution is an important step towards greater fairness and equity in academia and publishing. They suggest that their approach can be used to promote more accurate and unbiased authorial gender attribution and to reduce the impact of gender-based stereotypes."

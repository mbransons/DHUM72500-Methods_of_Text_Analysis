The results return a list of contextual phrases with the keyword centered and strings of characters capped front and back. The algorithm behind the function allows the user to extract samples from a text and put it into a new context. The material practice of producing this data involves decisions I make with search, what the author writes in the text, and what the authors of the algorithm provides to us. Any meanings possibly derived from this data connects as much to this moment in time that allows us to readily produce the data in the first place."

NLTK's text is a particularly structured object of a text that then has a larger number of functions and methods that might be applied to 'read' the text. The NLTK text and its reading is constrained by the neccessary structure required by the creators of the toolkit that have defined what form a 'text' must take before it might be interpreted. McGann would allow a reader to imagine any number of tools and any number of ways we might read a text in order to interpret it."

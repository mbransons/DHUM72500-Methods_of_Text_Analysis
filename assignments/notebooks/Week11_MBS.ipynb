Supervised learning means that we have a dataset with accurate labels to work from, and that we train the model using about 80% of the dataset as \"training\" data. Then, we test the accuracy of the model on a remaining subset of data (typically about 20% or less). We can validate the model if we have labels for the testing dataset. We're going to learn how to take a dataset and divide it into training and testing sets, to validate the model by evaluating its accuracy, and then applying cross-validation techniques. "

        "## Supervised Learning\n",
        "Text classification is one form of machine learning (ML) that falls under supervised learning. As we learned from reading Meredith Broussard, supervised learning requires that we have a dataset with labeled data points. We use that data and through computational processes that compare features of each observation, the machine develops a prediction as to which features from the data are most likely related to the labels associated with it. The output of the training set is a model. In the model we are about to create, we will use independent text variables, such as title and description to predict the priority or the component associated with it. \n",
        "\n",
        "A supervised machine learning method maps a function from the input to the output based on calculating statistical likelihoods that there is a relationship between variables. That, ultimately, is what we're defining as \"learning.\" \n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, we have to know whether or not the model is reflective of what we would be satisfied to call \"reality\" or \"true.\" Therefore, we divide the process in two components. First, we \"train\" the model, which means we use the largest amount of data and labels so that the computer comes up with predictions of the relationships between the text and the label we assigned to it. Next, we use a smaller subset of the same data to test how accurate the model's predictions are. The more features we add to the model, presumably, the more likely we are to get accurate results. In other words, if we know more than Priority, but also the day of the week that the bug report is submitted or the time of day... by increasing the density of the feature vector (remember from our vectorizing assignments), the idea is that we improve the liklihood that the model \"trained\" will be accurate (which is to say reflected of our expected reality). \n",
        "\n",
        "## How it works\n",
        "During the training phase, we take text documents and their associated labels and we create vectors that both describe the text and include the presence or absence of the labeled features. The computer runs those vectors through statistical processes that calculate the likelihood that relationships between vectors exist. The output is a model that includes various statistical predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "The next step is that we take new text data and we feed the text vectors--this time without the labels--to the trained model. Then we use the model to output the statistical likelihood that that the text is associated with each of the labels based on what it \"learned\" during the first phase. \n",
        "\n",
        "We can then predict the accuracy with which the model is able to predict the relationship between a text document and a label by comparing the predictions to the actual labels of the tested dataset. \n",

The target variable is the one we will ultimately test for. That's why we have an X train (text) and a X test (priority) and a Y train (text) and a Y test (priority). We designate that we want the test_size to be 20% (in decimals) and then we set a random state, which is simply something the computer needs to begin a random selection process. Changing the random state should not change the outcome of the model if the model is accurate; however, if you were to change the random_state variable, you are likely to come up with a different composition of testing and training datasets. Finally, we use `stratify` to make sure that we're selecting proportionately among the various priority labels. At this point, we just want to know if data is a priority or not. We don't want to bias the model by skewing it toward one priority type. (Note: we'll come back to this later). "

        "# Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search\n",
        "Grid-search is a tool that we can use to improve a model's accuracy by systematically evaluating the parameters of the arguments we feed to the model. The process includes trying out different combinations of *hyperparameters* to improve the desired output. [Hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning) set the boundaries of the \"learning\" process. When we use grid-search, we provide a set of parameter values that we can evaluate. Combining this with cross-validation will help to identify the hyperparameters that are impacting the model and provide clues as to where to make adjustments to improve the accuracy of the results. \n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, a `training_pipeline` defines the steps that we would like to run. The following example specifies tf-idf vectorization and the LinearSVC model from scikit-learn. Then, the `grid_param` argument allows us to define the parameters that we want to test. Parameters are specific to each phase in the pipeline, so we use the name of the phase as a prefix to specify what we're testing for. So, for example, min_df is a parameter, so we call it `tfidf_min_df`. In the last phase, we call the GridSearchCV method, which automates the process of testing multiple versions of the entire piepline with different sets of hyperparameters and produces a cross-validation score for each. That allows us to pick the best performing pipeline and model. \n",
        "\n",
        "The following step will take a bit of time. Be sure that you can let the process run without the notebook disconnecting so that it can finish. "
